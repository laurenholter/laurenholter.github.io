                <h2>Hi!</h2>
                <p>I'm a freelance writer, editor, and content strategist. My specialty is telling stories and packaging content so it's digestible and grabs an audience's attention â€” whether it's web content, blog posts, emails, newsletters, or social media copy. I've delivered content for companies in a range of fields, including data analytics and financial services. My background is in journalism, and I was previously a Contributing Editor at Bustle and a Senior Editor at The Frisky. I'm currently based in London by way of New York.</p>
