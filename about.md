# Hi!

I write and edit words about news, politics, reproductive rights, and the environment. I'm currently freelancing and have been published on Refinery29, Bustle, The Frisky, BKLYNR, and elsewhere. My address is in Brooklyn, but will soon be across the pond.

Find me on Twitter [@laurenholter](https://twitter.com/laurenholter) or at laurentholter@gmail.
