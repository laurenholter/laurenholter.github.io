# Brock Turner’s Mugshot Was Finally Released, And Here’s Why That Matters So Much

The former Stanford swimmer convicted of raping an unconscious woman in March was sentenced to six months
in jail Thursday, as well as the stipulation that he register as a sex offender for the rest of his life. He could be out
after just three months if he behaves himself behind bars, and the light sentence was heavily criticized as a slap
in the face to rape survivors. Not only did he scrape by with hardly any time in prison, the 20-year-old convicted
rapist doesn’t have a mug shot circulating the media; however, it’s extremely important that Brock Turner’s mug
shot be released, and he be treated like any other rapist.

*Update: Turner’s mug shot was finally released Monday. However, this article will remain as is, because it’s
important to talk about why his mug shot matters and how images displayed in the media differ based on the
race of the criminal.*

On top of his standing as an athlete at a prestigious university, Turner had another factor working in his favor —
his whiteness. Even if you ignore his almost laughable sentence for raping an unconscious woman behind a
dumpster on Stanford’s campus in 2015, the fact that news stories about Turner are accompanied by either a
school photo or photos of him in a suit for court is testament enough to the positive treatment he’s received from
the criminal justice system and the public alike. The 20-year-old has now been found guilty of and sentenced for
a felony sexual assault, so where’s his criminal mug shot?

Despite being convicted of heinous crimes, white male criminals are still shown in the media through graduation
or other school photos, while stories about criminals of color almost always feature mug shots. There are no
statistics on the prevalence of mug shot usage in the media in relation to race (go figure), but the pattern is clear.
Last year, sister news sites TheGazette.com and KCRG.com published stories about two burglaries the same day
— one carried out by a group of white men and the other by a group of black men. The story about the young
white burglars originally showed all three men’s college photos, while the story about the four black men had
only mug shots. The story about the blonde white men was eventually updated to include their mug shots, but not
until a week later, when most everyone had already seen the story.

In KCRG’s defense, they said they were using the best images available at the time, which is true. This story is
led by Turner’s yearbook photo because that’s all that’s out there right now. White criminals’ mug shots just
aren’t released (or sought out) as often as people of color’s.

The problem goes much deeper than simply who’s mug shots are being distributed though. Crimes committed by
non-white people get much more attention than crimes committed by white people. A 2015 Media Matters for
America report revealed that while men of color were arrested for 49 percent of assault cases in New York City
between 2010 and 2013, 73 percent of news stories on the subject were about men of color during the last five
months of 2014. Not only do white men avoid having their mug shots broadcast to the world, they also tend to
avoid having their crimes talked about at all.

Black men are even sometimes portrayed as criminals when they’re the victim. Sam DuBose, who was fatally
shot by University of Cincinnati police officer Ray Tensing last summer, was memorialized in the media with a
mug shot, while the officer who killed him was often shown in his police uniform. While white men don’t have
their mug shot blast to the world when found guilty of a violent crime, black men do even when they’re the one
hurt or killed.
Obviously, mug shots relay a much different image of someone than a professionally-taken university photo.
Even though Turner was deemed a rapist by the court and will spend time behind bars for his crime, his photo is
still portraying him as a respectable member of society. No one looks good in a mug shot (except maybe Lindsey
Lohan), and the grainy quality, orange jumpsuit, and look of either distress or disdain automatically make a
suspect look more guilty. While I’m not an authority on the subject, I can say with confidence that a mug shot
makes a person look a hell of a lot more guilty than a nearly perfect yearbook photo.

Turner’s friend, Leslie Rasmussen, wrote a letter to the sentencing judge claiming that Turner’s conviction was a
misunderstanding. “Where do we draw the line and stop worrying about being politically correct every second of
the day and see that rape on campuses isn’t always because people are rapists,” Rasmussen wrote. First of all,
logic suggests that if a rape occurred, a rapist was involved. However, if Rasmussen is so concerned that Turner
is a “victim” of too much political correctness, she should take the photos of him circulating the web into
consideration. His treatment in the press has been incredibly politically incorrect, since he’s received much better
treatment than a young black man would have.

Regardless of his swimming accolades, the fancy new suit he wore to court, and the fact that his dad says he’s
too broken up about his conviction to eat steak (poor baby), Turner deserves to be treated like the rapist he is. He
was convicted of a violent sexual assault — the media has absolutely no obligation to paint him in a positive
light. In fact, the media has an obligation to paint him in the same negative light it paints rapists of color — with
an unflattering mug shot.
